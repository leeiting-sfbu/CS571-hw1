To test the city_converter.py: Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000/zipcode?city=New%20York to test the zip code endpoint. You should see the message "Zip code for New York is 10001". You can replace the city name in the URL to test for different cities. There are only three cities in the database: New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.
